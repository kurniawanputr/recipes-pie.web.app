<p>Hey everyone, it&rsquo;s Drew, welcome to my recipe page. Today, I will show you a way to make a special dish, apple pie. It is one of my favorites. This time, I will make it a bit tasty. This will be really delicious.</p>
<p>Apple Pie is one of the most popular of recent trending foods on earth. It&rsquo;s enjoyed by millions daily. It is simple, it&rsquo;s quick, it tastes delicious. Apple Pie is something which I have loved my whole life. They are fine and they look fantastic.</p>
<p>To get started with this particular recipe, we have to first prepare a few ingredients. You can have apple pie using 19 ingredients and 5 steps. Here is how you can achieve that.</p>

<script></script>
<h5 id="the-ingredients-needed-to-make-apple-pie">The ingredients needed to make Apple Pie:</h5>
<ol>
<li>Make ready  Oil Pie Crust</li>
<li>Get 3 Cups All-purpose Flour</li>
<li>Make ready 1 tsp Salt</li>
<li>Take 3/4 Cup Grape Seed Oil or Flavorless Oil of Choice</li>
<li>Get 5 Tbsp Ice Cold Water</li>
<li>Make ready 1 Egg (Egg Wash)</li>
<li>Prepare 1 Tbsp White Sugar (Topping) Optional</li>
<li>Take 1 tsp Cinnamon (Topping) Optional</li>
<li>Get  Pie Filling</li>
<li>Make ready 5-6 Large Honey Crisp Apples</li>
<li>Take 1 Lemon (Juice)</li>
<li>Take 1 Orange (Zest)</li>
<li>Prepare 1/2 Cup White Sugar</li>
<li>Get 1/4 Cup Brown Sugar</li>
<li>Prepare 3 Tbsp All-purpose Flour</li>
<li>Get 1 1/2 tsp Cinnamon</li>
<li>Make ready 1/4 tsp Grated Nutmeg</li>
<li>Make ready 1/4 tsp Salt</li>
<li>Take 1-2 Tbsp Unsalted Butter</li>
</ol>

<script></script>
<h5 id="instructions-to-make-apple-pie">Instructions to make Apple Pie:</h5>
<ol>
<li>Preheat Oven to 425°F. Fill a Cup with Water and Ice. In a Large Mixing Bowl, Combine Flour and Salt. In a Smaller Bowl or Glass Measuring Cup, pour Oil and 5 Tbsp of the Ice Water. Don't mix. Add Oil and Water to the Flour Mixture. Stir with a fork until a ball begins to form. If the Dough is still crumbly, add another Tbsp of Ice Water. Keep adding 1 Tbsp at a time, until the Dough is the right consistency and it holds together. Some crumbles are okay. Don't over wet the Dough.</li>
<li>Divide the Dough into two equal balls. Put each in an airtight container, &amp; refrigerate for at least 20 Mins. For the first Pie Crust, place one of the Dough Balls between two pieces of wax paper. Roll out Dough evenly, until it's a 12&quot;Circle. Gently peel off top layer of wax paper. Invert a 9&quot; Pie Pan (sprayed with cooking spray or butter) on top of Dough. Make sure it's centered well &amp; there is overhang around the pan. Flip Dough and Pan over together, &amp; then carefully peel off wax paper.</li>
<li>Peel, Core, &amp; Slice Apples. I like mine about 1/4 in. Put Apples into a Large Mixing Bowl, &amp; add Lemon Juice. Stir well. Add Sugar, Brown Sugar, Cinnamon, Nutmeg, Flour, &amp; Orange Zest. Mix Well. Place Apples in the Pie Crust. Cut butter in cubes, &amp; disperse evenly over Apples. Roll out the other Pie Crust the same way as first, peel wax paper, place on top of Apples.</li>
<li>Pinch both crusts together all around the edges. Cut off any excess. Fold crust under all the way around the Pie, so that the crust sits evenly against Pie Plate border. Crimp edges as you like. Brush Egg Wash lightly all over the top of the Pie Crust. Sprinkle Sugar &amp; Cinnamon on top. Cut four 2&quot; slits in Crust toward the top center of Pie Crust.</li>
<li>Cover a Baking Sheet with Aluminum Foil. Place Pie on Baking Sheet. Bake for 55 Mins to 1 Hour. Check Crust Edges after about a half hour. If they are getting too brown, cover edges in Aluminum Foil or a Pie Protector. Allow to Cool for 1 - 3 Hours. The longer you allow it to cool, the better. The filling will have a better chance to thicken up. Enjoy!</li>
