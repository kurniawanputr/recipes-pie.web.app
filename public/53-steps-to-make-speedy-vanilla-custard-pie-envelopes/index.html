<p>Hey everyone, it is me, Dave, welcome to my recipe page. Today, I will show you a way to prepare a distinctive dish, vanilla custard pie envelopes. It is one of my favorites food recipes. For mine, I&rsquo;m gonna make it a bit tasty. This is gonna smell and look delicious.</p>
<p>Silky Creamy Custard Pie brings eggs, cream, milk, sugar and vanilla into an incredibly sweet creamy treat that is prepped in a matter of minutes. Do you remember the way our grandparents used to cook with wholesome ingredients that everyone knew by name? There weren't box mixes and shortcuts.</p>
<p>Vanilla Custard Pie Envelopes is one of the most favored of current trending meals on earth. It is appreciated by millions daily. It is easy, it&rsquo;s fast, it tastes yummy. Vanilla Custard Pie Envelopes is something that I&rsquo;ve loved my entire life. They are fine and they look wonderful.</p>
<p>To get started with this particular recipe, we have to first prepare a few ingredients. You can cook vanilla custard pie envelopes using 15 ingredients and 18 steps. Here is how you cook that.</p>

<script></script>
<h5 id="the-ingredients-needed-to-make-vanilla-custard-pie-envelopes">The ingredients needed to make Vanilla Custard Pie Envelopes:</h5>
<ol>
<li>Make ready  Custard</li>
<li>Prepare 1/3 cup white sugar</li>
<li>Make ready 2 tsp vanilla extract</li>
<li>Get 2 medium-sized egg yolks</li>
<li>Make ready 1 1/2 cup whole milk</li>
<li>Make ready 2 tbsp + 1/4 tsp cornstarch</li>
<li>Prepare  Pie crust</li>
<li>Make ready 1 1/2 cup AP flour</li>
<li>Make ready 1/4 tsp baking powder</li>
<li>Take 1/2 tsp salt</li>
<li>Make ready 2 tbsp white sugar</li>
<li>Take 1/3 cup butter</li>
<li>Prepare 1 tsp vanilla bean extract</li>
<li>Make ready 4 tbsp + 1/4 tsp whole milk</li>
<li>Prepare 1 egg (for eggwash)</li>
</ol>
<p>Combine caster sugar, cornflour and custard powder in a small saucepan. A creamy vanilla and buttermilk custard envelopes a pile of perfectly plump pears, all baked off in an all-butter pie crust. Yesterday my husband and I packed up our car. Make an upright (rather than flat) crimp around the edge, as pictured above; this will help keep the filling from sloshing out as you move the pie from counter to oven.</p>

<li>First, let’s make the custard. In a medium-sized sauce pan, combine everything but the cornstarch. Once the sugar has dissolved, add the cornstarch and mix quickly to avoid lumps. Cook on low heat for 5 minutes; stir constantly.</li>
<li>In about 1 minute you will begin to feel the mixture thickening. Keep stirring for the remaining time of 4 minutes.</li>
<li>Pour the custard inside an air-tight container; chill in the fridge for 1+ hours. (If you don’t have time to prepare the pie crust envelope, this custard recipe is amazing to eat as is.)</li>
<li>Whisk the egg and 1 tbsp of cold water together to make the eggwash; set aside.</li>
<li>Next, it’s crust time! You can either use the recipe I’m listing below, or you can use your favorite pre-made pie dough. I always recommend making things from scratch.)</li>
<li>Preheat oven to 200 degrees Celsius. (400 degrees Fahrenheit)</li>
<li>Then, combine your dry ingredients in a medium-sized bowl and mix with a fork or whisk. Next, add the butter and use your fingers to combine everything until the texture is crumbly.</li>
<li>In a separate bowl, combine milk and vanilla bean extract (or vanilla extract) together. Then, add it to the dry mixture. Mix by hand until you have formed a ball of dough.</li>

<li>Take aluminum foil and loosely fold vertically several times. Once you reach the top, fold over horizontally 2-3 times. This is going to be used as the mold for creating the crust envelope. Spray the foil generously with olive oil spray to avoid sticking.</li>
<li>Make sure that the foil is not completely flat so that you will have enough room to fill the envelopes with the custard.</li>
<li>Place the folded aluminum foil on top of one of the pre-cut dough pieces. Pull up one corner of the dough, then fold the corners on the left and right on top to make an envelope shape.</li>
<li>With a pastry brush, gently coat the envelopes with the eggwash. Lightly sprinkle sparkling sugar, or granulated sugar on top of the envelopes. Bake with the foil inside the envelope for 18-20 minutes.</li>
<li>OPTIONAL: Use the extra scraps of dough and make a small shape or design to add something fun on the front of the envelope like I did.</li>
<li>Take out of the oven and let it cool for about 5 minutes. Then, gently pull out the foil.</li>
<li>Fill a piping bag with the custard, and pipe it into the envelope until it reaches the top. Be careful not to overfill it otherwise the crust might crack slightly.</li>
<li>Top with your favorite fruit or eat as is. (I used diced bananas and whipped cream!)</li>
<li>Yes, please!! 🤤</li>
