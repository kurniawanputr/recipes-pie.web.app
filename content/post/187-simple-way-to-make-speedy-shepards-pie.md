recipeinstructions:
- "Bring a large pot of water to a boil, add salt to allow water to boil faster. While your water is boiling this is a great time to make sure your work area is clean, and all your ingredients are easily assessable."
- "Before adding your potatoes to the now boiling water. Make sure they are cleaned, also pro tip score the potato around the center, this will allow you to remove the skin easier later. Boiling your potatoes should take around 20 minutes. You can test them with a fork if it easily goes through the Potato it should be done."
- "When your potatoes are fully cooked place them in an ice bath for a few minutes long enough so they are able to handle. The section your scored earlier should allow you to remove the skin in two parts. Go ahead and preheat your oven to 350 degrees."
- "Go ahead and smash them Tatar’s up, add 2 parts of the garlic to the potatoes, the whipping cream, cheese,1/2 of the butter, and salt and pepper to taste. Mix well until combined. Set mixture aside on the counter top, I put a cloth over it to avoid any unwelcome visitors, such as dust, etc."
- "You can now go ahead and brown your ground beef up adding the rest of the garlic, and dry ingredients. After your ground beef is browned add your frozen veggies, and store them around until thawed. At this point you might have some excess liqiud in your pan going on. Go ahead and drain it but keep some to the side to add into the dish before putting it into the oven."
- "Add the meat and veggie mixture to the ceramic dish care not to over flow cause we will still want to add those mashed tators on top. Takes the liquid we saved earlier and pour in the ceramic dish as well just enough to avoid spillage in the oven."
- "Now you don’t have to be fancy, you can put the potato mixture on top just regular, or you can create a smooth surface and pipe some pretty designs on top. Either way it’s going to taste amazing."
- "Allow to cook in the oven for about 20 minutes, or until the top becomes golden. Remove from oven after competed and garnish with parsley. Let set for about 10 minutes and serve!"
