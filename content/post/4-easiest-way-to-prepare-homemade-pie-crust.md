Hello everybody, I hope you are having an amazing day today. Today, I will show you a way to prepare a special dish, pie crust. It is one of my favorites food recipes. This time, I will make it a bit tasty. This is gonna smell and look delicious.

A more forgiving pie crust is one that is made with a mixture of butter and shortening. That way you get the flavor of the butter, with the easy flakiness that comes from using shortening. Some people use all vegetable oil, and some swear by lard.

Pie Crust is one of the most favored of recent trending meals in the world. It's appreciated by millions daily. It is easy, it is quick, it tastes yummy. Pie Crust is something which I have loved my entire life. They're nice and they look wonderful.


To begin with this recipe, we must prepare a few components. You can have pie crust using 4 ingredients and 4 steps. Here is how you can achieve that.

##### The ingredients needed to make Pie Crust:

1. Get 2 cups flour
1. Make ready 1 tsp salt
1. Take 2/3 cup Crisco
1. Prepare 8-12 tbsp ice water


By the way, you can make a double batch of this, and freeze the individually wrapped dough for future pie-related adventures. We&#39;ve been making pie crust the same way in our kitchen for years. We cut butter (or other solid fat) into flour until the butter and flour looks crumbly and has pieces of butter the size of peas. Then, we add just enough water to form the dough into a ball.

##### Instructions to make Pie Crust:

1. Sifted flour and add the salt. Whisk together
1. Add the Crisco and cut in with pastry blender
1. Add the water and fold in. Don&#39;t play with it like play-doe
1. Divide into 2 equal balls. Flatten into two 1 inch disk. Wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate for one hour


That was until we found a better way. Pie crust is not bread dough, and if you overwork the dough, the crust will become quite tough and difficult to handle. Be a minimalist when it comes to mixing the water into the flour. Less touching means more tender dough. Learn how to perfect a two-crust pie, how to blind bake a crust, and even how to store pie crust.because there&#39;s no such thing as too much of a good thing.
