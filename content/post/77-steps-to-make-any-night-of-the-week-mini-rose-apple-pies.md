recipeingredient:
- " Pie crust"
- "1 1/2 cups AP flour"
- "1/2 tsp salt"
- "2 tbsp white sugar"
- "1/4 tsp baking powder"
- "4 tbsp  14 tsp whole milk or lowfat"
- "1 tsp vanilla bean extract"
- "1/3 cup butter"
- " Apple Filling"
- "2 mediumsized red apples"
- "2 tbsp butter"
- "1 tbsp white sugar"
- "1 tsp light brown sugar"
- "1 tsp cinnamon"
recipeinstructions:
- "Preheat oven to 200 degrees Celsius. (400 degrees Fahrenheit)"
- "Let’s make the crust. First, combine all the dry ingredients in a medium-size bowl and whisk together."
- "Next, add in the 1/3 cup of butter and combine with your fingers until crumbly."
- "In a small separate bowl, mix the milk and vanilla bean extract together."
- "Slowly pour the milk mixture into the bowl of dry ingredients. Use your hands to form a ball of dough."
- "Once there is no remaining flour in the bowl, take the dough out and wrap in Saran wrap and chill in the fridge for 20 minutes."
- "Now let’s move on to the apple filling. First, peel your apples and then cut them into cheeks. (Cheeks are slices of the apple that are cut thinly.)"
- "Put the cheeks into a medium-sized bowl, then add the white sugar, brown sugar, and cinnamon; mix well with your hands."
- "In a large pan, turn the heat on medium-low and add the 2 tbsp butter; let it melt. Once the butter has melted, add the apples and cook for 3 minutes, or until they are soft. Set aside in a bowl."
- "Take the dough out of the fridge and cut in half."
- "Roll out your dough and using a large circular cookie cutter, cut out your mini pie crust. (If you don’t have a large circular cookie cutter on hand, I actually use a glass cup to cut my dough out.) Roll out the mini pie crusts until you reach your desired thickness."
- "Place the dough into a cupcake mold or tin that’s been lightly coated with olive oil spray, or greased with butter. If you are baking with a silicone cupcake mold, like I did, you don’t need to spray or grease it. Use a fork and prick the bottom of the crust 3 times. Bake for 15 minutes."
- "After 15 minutes, take the crust out of the oven and add the apples. You can lay the apples down inside, filling the crust, or do a rose pattern, which is what I do to make it look more attractive."
- "To make a rose pattern take a slice of apple and push against the side of the dough and begin doing a spiral until you’ve filled the pie crust with apples. Bake for another 10 minutes."
- "Pair with whipped cream and caramel sauce, or with powdered sugar and vanilla ice cream!"
