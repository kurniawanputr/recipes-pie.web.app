recipeingredient:
- " Custard"
- "1/3 cup white sugar"
- "2 tsp vanilla extract"
- "2 mediumsized egg yolks"
- "1 1/2 cup whole milk"
- "2 tbsp  14 tsp cornstarch"
- " Pie crust"
- "1 1/2 cup AP flour"
- "1/4 tsp baking powder"
- "1/2 tsp salt"
- "2 tbsp white sugar"
- "1/3 cup butter"
- "1 tsp vanilla bean extract"
- "4 tbsp  14 tsp whole milk"
- "1 egg for eggwash"
recipeinstructions:
- "First, letâ€™s make the custard. In a medium-sized sauce pan, combine everything but the cornstarch. Once the sugar has dissolved, add the cornstarch and mix quickly to avoid lumps. Cook on low heat for 5 minutes; stir constantly."
- "In about 1 minute you will begin to feel the mixture thickening. Keep stirring for the remaining time of 4 minutes."
- "Pour the custard inside an air-tight container; chill in the fridge for 1+ hours. (If you donâ€™t have time to prepare the pie crust envelope, this custard recipe is amazing to eat as is.)"
- "Whisk the egg and 1 tbsp of cold water together to make the eggwash; set aside."
- "Next, itâ€™s crust time! You can either use the recipe Iâ€™m listing below, or you can use your favorite pre-made pie dough. I always recommend making things from scratch.)"
- "Preheat oven to 200 degrees Celsius. (400 degrees Fahrenheit)"
- "Then, combine your dry ingredients in a medium-sized bowl and mix with a fork or whisk. Next, add the butter and use your fingers to combine everything until the texture is crumbly."
- "In a separate bowl, combine milk and vanilla bean extract (or vanilla extract) together. Then, add it to the dry mixture. Mix by hand until you have formed a ball of dough."
- "Roll out your dough and cut into a large square. Cut into 4 equal-sized pieces. Set aside your scraps of dough to use later."
- "Take aluminum foil and loosely fold vertically several times. Once you reach the top, fold over horizontally 2-3 times. This is going to be used as the mold for creating the crust envelope. Spray the foil generously with olive oil spray to avoid sticking."
- "Make sure that the foil is not completely flat so that you will have enough room to fill the envelopes with the custard."
- "Place the folded aluminum foil on top of one of the pre-cut dough pieces. Pull up one corner of the dough, then fold the corners on the left and right on top to make an envelope shape."
- "With a pastry brush, gently coat the envelopes with the eggwash. Lightly sprinkle sparkling sugar, or granulated sugar on top of the envelopes. Bake with the foil inside the envelope for 18-20 minutes."
- "OPTIONAL: Use the extra scraps of dough and make a small shape or design to add something fun on the front of the envelope like I did."
- "Take out of the oven and let it cool for about 5 minutes. Then, gently pull out the foil."
- "Fill a piping bag with the custard, and pipe it into the envelope until it reaches the top. Be careful not to overfill it otherwise the crust might crack slightly."
- "Top with your favorite fruit or eat as is. (I used diced bananas and whipped cream!)"
- "Yes, please!! ðŸ¤¤"

Combine caster sugar, cornflour and custard powder in a small saucepan. A creamy vanilla and buttermilk custard envelopes a pile of perfectly plump pears, all baked off in an all-butter pie crust. Yesterday my husband and I packed up our car. Make an upright (rather than flat) crimp around the edge, as pictured above; this will help keep the filling from sloshing out as you move the pie from counter to oven.
