- "1 cup Corn syrup"
- "1/2 tsp Salt"
- "1 tsp Vanilla extract"
- "3 Eggs"
- "2 cup Pecan halves"
- "1 Refrigerated pie crust"
recipeinstructions:
- "Heat oven to 375°F."
- "Roll out pie crust into a pie pan. Use whatever method you like for the edges of your pie. I suggest youtube for ideas."
- "Beat sugar, corn syrup, vanilla, salt and eggs in a bowl with a wire whisk until well blended."
- "Rough chop half your pecans and add to your sugar egg mixture. Please note the original recipe called for 1 cup however my family really likes a lot of pecans so at this point do what your family would prefer. Start with 1 cup and see how it looks to you."
- "Pour your sugar, egg, pecan mixture into your prepared pie crust."
- "My daughter likes to then take the second half of the pecans and arrange them beautifully on the top, make sure you push them down enough to get a bit of the sugar mixture over each pecan. You can just sprinkle the other half of them over your pie but remember to push them down."
- "Bake your pie for 40-50 minutes until center is set. Half way through your cooking loosely wrap foil around the edge of your pie crust to prevent burning-This might take a bit of practice but your pie crust edges will not be slightly burned after such a long cooking time."
- "Let your pie sit for about 20-30 minutes before serving. We like ours with vanilla ice cream or whip cream."
